In 2013 I knew it was a political tool, and tried to speak up.  @elonmusk it has to stop, the banking system used as a tool of state corruption and cronyism is now a monster. Please DOGE this.   —  I was in the Merchant Processing business since 1985, one of my specialties was to get a legal Merchant Account to any legal business.  Banks would not only do a poor job of selling this services, they refused service to 75% of new businesses and 200% of “high risk” businesses. To sell a Merchant Accounts. But you need a bank who is chartered with Visa and Mastercard to offer a Merchant Account. Thus became the shot gun marriage for the industry, the banks hated us and we hated them, we both needed each other.  To underwrite a “high risk” merchant I had to take 100% liability if the bank had any form of loss, plus penalties. Thusly I developed early AI to monitor and underwrite these merchants. No one else in the world: did this until Square in 2011. I was doing Square and Stripe before the founders of those companies got out of diapers. Love those guys but I did it better and faster with customers that are still processing, decades later.  So a very cold morning in Southern California I got a call at 4 am from an east coast executive of one of the banks I represented: “Brian we have to shut down 780 merchants in your portfolio now. The Comptroller of The Currency and an FBI squad just walked walked in, we are losing over 2000 accounts”. Each merchant was doing legal business and some were 10 year working with us. It made no sense.   After the dust settled I got the inside word from a person that was part of the team, they were nice and all knew it was the start of a Soviet style payback operation.  I watched over 15,000 merchants, nearly 10% of my business, get the plug pulled in the space of a few weeks with every bank I had a relationship with.  I knew these merchants many personally and had to see their dreams burn down because of cronyism, games and people scared at the banks and over doing their jobs.   They destroyed so many people.  But how did this start?  Big political donations from Native American Gambling cartels and Las Vegas Gambling cartels, they both hated each other and got together to stop legal US betting for legal Online casinos.  They also wanted no sex workers to accept a credit card directly, it had to go through their pump first and then they got their cut.  It was the perfect cover “Gambling and Sex” who is coming to publicly defend it? Especially banks. But of course it was a cover for controlling the banking system to a level that was never possible.  It wasn’t just those industries it impacted just about any online business because of the way it was being pushed so hard on banks.  Over the years I got to see first hand the ugly hands corruption rapidly expand. This impacted all businesses and raised cost by 10x  to do business.  It stopped “officially” in 2017. But it stated up again in 2021 and this time it was more ugly and more vengeful Operation Chokehold 2.0.  And as @pmarca points out in the @joeroganhq pairing linked in the reposting attached here, they went after people to control them politically.  This type of behavior must stop. Using the financial system through the government leavers of power for political ends has destroyed the faith and fabric of our society and economy.   There is a lot more to this story and someday I will write about it.  DOGE STOP THIS  CRONYISM.",Brian Roemmele,3941,38,899,177

Elon Musk explains his motivation for keeping it real. Elon was asked, ""I notice you as being always honest, and where did that come from in your life?""  Elon's response was rapid, ""Yes, I can totally tell, you... well first of all I aspire to be honest, but I'm also sometimes wrong. Obviously, you can't be right all the time. I believe one should stand as corrected.""  ""The reason I try to be honest is because I am trying to understand the universe. I am trying to understand reality. I am trying to understand, like, what's the meaning of life...what are we here for? What's going on?""  ""If you are not rigorous about truth and honesty than you are going to live in a deluded world. You won't understand the nature of reality. I'm just curious and I want to understand the nature of reality, that that requires rigorous adherence to the truth.""

Elon was asked about about the many famous celebrities who stood up to endorse Kamala Harris for president. It is impressive how Elon was solid about his support for Trump when this clearly was not the norm for the rich and famous to do.   The norm was to endorse Harris. In fact, all of these celebrities and more endorsed or supported Harris:  Alyssa Milano, Amber Rose, Ana Navarro, Anna Wintour, Anthony Rapp, Ariana Grande, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Aubrey Plaza, Azealia Banks, Barbra Streisand, Beyoncé, Bill Nye, Billie Eilish, Billy Eichner, Bon Jovi, Bruce Springsteen, Cardi B, Charli XCX, Cher, Chris Janson, Christina Aguilera, Chloë Grace Moretz, Cynthia Nixon, Danai Gurira, Demi Lovato, Dennis Quaid, Dolly Parton, Don Cheadle, Don Omar, Eminem, Eva Longoria, Fat Joe, Finneas O'Connell, Foo Fighters, Fran Drescher, Garcelle Beauvais, George Clooney, Geraldo Rivera, Gracie Abrams, Harrison Ford, Insane Clown Posse, James Taylor, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jason Aldean, Jay Z, Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Lawrence, John Legend, John Oliver, Jon Voight, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Julia Roberts, Katy Perry, Kelly Rowland, Ken Burns, Kesha, Kerry Washington, Kid Rock, Lance Bass, Lady Gaga, LeBron James, Leonardo DiCaprio, LeVar Burton, Lili Reinhart, Lizzo, Madonna, Marc Anthony, Mark Hamill, Mark Ruffalo, Martha Stewart, Matt Damon, Megan Thee Stallion, Mel Brooks, Mel Gibson, Mick Jagger, Mindy Kaling, Misha Collins, Mumford & Sons, Nancy Sinatra, Nick Offerman, Nicky Jam, Octavia Spencer, Olivia Rodrigo, Oprah Winfrey, Paul Bettany, Peter Frampton, Questlove & The Roots, Reese Witherspoon, Rihanna, Robert De Niro, Robert Downey Jr., Rosie O'Donnell, Rosie Perez, Sarah Jessica Parker, Scarlett Johansson, Smokey Robinson, Spike Lee, Stevie Nicks, Taylor Swift, Tina Knowles, Tory Burch, Usher, Viola Davis, Will Ferrell, Willie Nelson, Whoopi Goldberg, and Zoe Saldaña have all shown support for Kamala Harris.  Elon observed, ""Yeah, its weird that there's so many celebrities endorsing Kamala.""  He added that he's trying his best, trying to make as big a difference as possible. ""I do think we are at a fork in the road of destiny.""  He also said ""It is not clear to me that there will be elections after this if Trump is not elected.""  Thankfully, Trump WAS elected, but there is much work ahead.  My 2 cents As a parent of 5 kids, I took my job as a mom of young kids more serious than anything I have ever encountered. Though my kids might have thought I was joking a lot, I had a deep urgency to prompt them in to being inquisitive and to dig deeper into things, and not just accept as a fact what they watch or are told.  If you have kids or plan to have them, please don't be worried about sending them to a ""school that might mislead them."" Instead, treat each school encounter like an experimental science lab, and get your kids to dissect and critically talk about everything they saw there, and what can they accept and what they can not accept.  ᴛʜᴇ ᴘɪᴇᴄᴇ ʏᴏᴜ ᴊᴜꜱᴛ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ɪꜱ ᴀ ᴛɪɴʏ ᴇxᴄᴇʀᴘᴛ ꜰʀᴏᴍ ᴍʏ ᴀʀᴛɪᴄʟᴇ ᴏɴ ᴇʟᴏɴ ᴍᴜꜱᴋ ᴛᴏᴡɴ ʜᴀʟʟꜱ. ᴛʜᴀɴᴋꜱ ꜰᴏʀ ʙᴇɪɴɢ ᴏɴ x. x ɪꜱ ᴡʜᴇʀᴇ ᴛʜᴇ ᴡᴏʀʟᴅ ɪꜱ.",Gail Alfar,5949,75,1010,304
